# MiscStuff
A bunch of small configurable (and disableable) tweaks for Sponge servers!

# Working Modules
* DisableAttackTime (disables 1.9's cooldown when attacking)
* DoubleJump (does what it says)
* NoWeather (does what it says)
* NoTarget (Causes mobs to think you're a ghost)

# WIP Modules
* FastItemDespawn (for less lag)
